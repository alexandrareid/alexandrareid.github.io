<div>
    <p>I got my cat Tabitha for my 14th birthday. We went to the shelter to pick her out and there she was, a little ball of fuzz and I knew I had to have her!</p>
    <p> We brought her home, but she didn't have a name for a few weeks so we just called her all sorts of things and my grandma still to this day calls her "baby kitty"</p></div>

<div>This is one of my favorite pictures I took of Tabitha, she is just so precious!</div>

<p>Tabitha is about 5 years old and is a grey Tabby cat rescue. When we first got her, her name was spooky boo </p>

<div>I have had Tabby for about 5 years, but over the summer she ran away and we haven't seen her since, I miss her a lot and hope one day she returns </div>
